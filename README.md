# Project-AIVAHr

Adaptive Interactive Virtual Assistant Humanoid robot (AIVAHr) System is an AI system created by me and my AI companion.
I do the brainstorming part and cooperating the code into Python and doing the debug,
while my AI companion (in GPT) helps me generate the Python code and thinks of solutions to solve the problems and bugs.

Ver 2.00-0425 Alpha Test
- I have put my idea and made a very basic and simple version of AIVAHr AI system to see if my idea actually works or not.
- It includes implementation of:
  1) Langchain as framework
  2) MiniCPM-o 2.6 as LLM
  3) SQLite as memory
  4) OpenAI Whisper as voice input
  5) etc.

To run it, needs to install all the dependencies.
Just pip install them in a virtual environment and use python to run the code.
I used Python 3.12, you may try newer version.
 
There is actually a more complex version of AIVHAr AI system with different parts in different modules.
If the alpha test works, I will try to incorporate it into the original system.
And hopefully I could upload that here in near future. 
(Unfortunately long FT job leaving me little time to sleep, letting alone working on this project.)
